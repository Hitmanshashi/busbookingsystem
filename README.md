## What is Buskaro?

BusKaro is an online bus ticket booking platform for Local Institutions and Societies. As a pilot implementation, BusKaro is designed and optimized for use in PDPM IIITDM Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, India.

BusKaro aims to make the long wait in queues obsolete. Tickets of all buses at all the time slots are made available for a comfortable booking experience, from anywhere. BusKaro provides the users the choice and comfort to plan their travel and evening get-outs from the comfort of their hostels and houses.

The buses are not owned or operated by BusKaro. The tickets for the same are available on BusKaro and are also available with the respective bus contractors.

## The Motivation

BusKaro was conceived as a part of the end semester project for Course CS201 - Database Management Systems. The primary motivation however was to get rid of the hassle of engaging in queues for booking bus tickets for self and sometimes for seniors.
